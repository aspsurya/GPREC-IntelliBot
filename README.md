# GPREC IntelliBot

An AI-Powered Navigator and Information Hub for GPREC Students.

## Abstract

Transitioning into college life can be challenging for new students, who often struggle to access essential information related to campus navigation, administrative procedures, and placement processes. To bridge this gap, we present GPREC IntelliBot â€“ an intelligent, multilingual student assistant that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver personalized, real-time guidance and support. The proposed system goes beyond static rule-based bots by integrating core ML components to enhance user interaction and adaptability.

## Key Features

* **NLP-Based Query Handling:** Understands and responds to diverse student queries using natural language processing.
* **Interactive Campus Map:** Offers a visual, clickable map for exploring campus locations and navigation.
* **Placement Analyzer and Predictor:** Recommends eligible companies based on student profiles and past placement data.
* **Real-Time Notification System:** Delivers timely updates on events, exams, and placements, personalized using ML.
* **Voice Interaction Support:** Allows hands-free question asking through speech recognition and intent detection.
